Assignment Test

## Here we have four test questions

Q-1) To forecast the sales data from the given data set

Have build the different models with applying different parameters of lag difference and seasonal lag differences and identified the best model which has least RMSE 


Q-2) To optmize with given business rules
with given below data The goal of this problem is to put as much #stuff into a container as it will hold while optimizing for #constraints such as item weight, size and value



Item    Value   Weight(kg)    volume

Flour   1680      0.265       0.41
Butter  1440      0.5         0.13
Sugar   1840      0.441       0.29

Here x1 as weight of Flour and x2 as weight of Butter and x3 as weight of Sugar in KGs, and defined objective funtion which combination gives the maximum value as per data with constraints on weight and volume of items

Using GA algorithm, identified the best possible values x1 and x2 and x3 with given constraints



Q-3) To write a program to compare the palanogram picture vs actual picture to identify the differnces

Here this questions like image classification and this is new topic and i would need more time to creat a program.
We can use different algorithm or custom program to compare the picture of acutal vs palnaogram picture.
Having said that- given more time i could develop the program for this question


Q-4) To find insigghts on hotel booking data and give recommendatiaons and forecast the number of total bookings for next days

Here, we have hotel bookings data and with 36 variables.
we could summaries of data and plot some data points depeneding on the potential variables and interesetd variable
have done few plots and identified in which months families are doing more bookings and we could concentrate provide offers in months of other months to families with children to visit more

In the same way have plotted other variable for reference and we could do more with some more data mining

And converted the hotel booking data into time series with grouping of data and count of booking
and build time series models and forecast the next seven days of hotel bookig as per requiremnt
